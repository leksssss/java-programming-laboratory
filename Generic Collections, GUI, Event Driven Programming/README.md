- Simple GUI
- ### Event Driven Programming - Your application chooses the number to be guessed by selecting an integer at random in the range 1–1000. As each guess is input, the background color should change to either red or blue. Red indicates that the user is getting “warmer,” and blue, “colder.” A JLabel should display either "Too High" or "Too Low" to help the user zero in. When the user gets the correct answer, "Correct!" should be displayed, and the JTextField used for input should be changed to be uneditable. A JButton should be provided to allow the user to play the game again.
