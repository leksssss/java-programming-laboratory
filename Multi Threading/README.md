## Week 09
- Define three classes : Mother, Plate and Child. Mother class should create a thread that starts counting the dosa made from 0(0,1,2â€¦) and it stores each value of dosa made in the Plate class. The Child class should create a thread which keep track of number of dosa made and print the number. Create instance of Mother, Plate and Child to explore the operation of threads.
- Modify the above program such that synchronization is implemented i.e each number of dosa is printed only once.
- Create your own NetworkingServer and NetworkingClient applications named as MyComputingServer and MyComputingClient. The client sends ten numbers and the server sends back sum of the numbers.
